@article{thomas_dill_1996,
	abstract = {"Statistical potentials" are energies widely used in computer algorithms to fold, dock, or recognize protein structures. They are derived from: (1) observed pairing frequencies of the 20 amino acids in databases of known protein structures, and (2) approximations and assumptions about the physical process that these quantities measure. Using exact lattice models, we construct a rigorous test of those assumptions and approximations. We find that statistical potentials often correctly rank-order the relative strengths of interresidue interactions, but they do not reflect the true underlying energies because of systematic errors arising from the neglect of excluded volume in proteins. We find that complex residue-residue distance dependences observed in statistical potentials, even those among charged groups, can be largely explained as an indirect consequence of the burial of non-polar groups. Our results suggest that current statistical potentials may have limited value in protein folding algorithms and wherever they are used to provide energy-like quantities.},

 abstract = {Energies required to transfer amino acid side chains from water to less polar environments were calculated from results of several studies and compared with several statistical analyses of residue distributions in soluble proteins. An analysis that divides proteins into layers parallel with their surfaces is more informative than those that simply classify residues as exposed or buried. Most residues appear to be distributed as a function of the distance from the protein-water interface in a manner consistent with partition energies calculated from partitioning of amino acids between water and octanol phases and from solubilities of amino acids in water, ethanol, and methanol. Lys, Arg, Tyr, and Trp residues tend to concentrate near the water-protein interface where their apolar side-chain components are more buried than their polar side-chain components. Residue distributions calculated in this manner do not correlate well with side-chain solvation energies calculated from vapor pressures of side-chain analogs over a water phase. Results of statistical studies that classify residues as exposed to solvent or buried inside the protein interior appear to depend on the method used to classify residues. Data from some of these studies correlate better with solvation energies, but other data correlate better with partition energies. Most other statistical methods that have been used to evaluate effects of water on residue distributions yield results that correlate better with partition energies than with solvation energies.},

Conformational parameters studied include main-chain torsion angles, root-mean-square fits, accessibility, mobility and protrusion indices. As observed before, the inhibitors share a common main-chain conformation at the binding loop from P3-P'3 (Schechter, Berger notation), which is maintained throughout all the serine proteinase inhibitor families for which X-ray data is available, despite lack of similarity in the rest of the protein. This canonical structure is not found amongst the limited proteolytic sites (or nicksites), which differ markedly from the inhibitor binding loop conformation, and also amongst themselves. The experimentally determined nicksites are in general both accessible and protruding; as are the inhibitor binding loops, as well as being typically flexible regions of structure, as denoted by elevated temperature factors from crystallographic determinations. For cleavage by serine proteinases these loops must radically alter their local conformations and a large motion of the loop relative to the structure, in some cases, would be required to orientate these sites for cleavage.},

	abstract = {We analyzed the total, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic accessible surfaces (ASAs) of residues from a nonredundant bank of 587 3D structure proteins. In an extended fold, residues are classified into three families with respect to their hydrophobicity balance. As expected, residues lose part of their solvent-accessible surface with folding but the three groups remain. The decrease of accessibility is more pronounced for hydrophobic than hydrophilic residues. Amazingly, Lysine is the residue with the largest hydrophobic accessible surface in folded structures. Our analysis points out a clear difference between the mean (other studies) and median (this study) ASA values of hydrophobic residues, which should be taken into consideration for future investigations on a protein-accessible surface, in order to improve predictions requiring ASA values. The different secondary structures correspond to different accessibility of residues. Random coils, turns, and beta-structures (outside beta-sheets) are the most accessible folds, with an average of 30\% accessibility. The helical residues are about 20\% accessible, and the difference between the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic residues illustrates the amphipathy of many helices. Residues from beta-sheets are the most inaccessible to solvent (10\% accessible). Hence, beta-sheets are the most appropriate structures to shield the hydrophobic parts of residues from water. We also show that there is an equal balance between the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic accessible surfaces of the 3D protein surfaces irrespective of the protein size. This results in a patchwork surface of hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas, which could be important for protein interactions and/or activity.},

The number of atoms in contact (within a distance of 4.5 A) can be used to describe the local environment of a residue. As this number increases, the accessible surface area (ASA) of the residue decreases exponentially and the variation can be described in terms of an exponential equation of the form y = a1exp(-x/a2), each residue having its own set of parameters a1 and a2, which also depend on whether the whole residue or just the side chain is considered. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues can be distinguished on the basis of both the average number of surrounding atoms and the variation of ASA. For a given number of partner atoms, a comparison of the observed ASA with the expected value obtained from the equation provides a method of assessing the goodness of packing of the residue in a protein structure or its importance in the binding of a ligand. The equation provides a method to estimate the ASA of a protein molecule and the average relative accessibilities of different residues, the latter being inversely correlated with hydrophobicity values. 10.1093/protein/15.8.659},

Recently, a number of nonnatural peptides with designed sequences have been elaborated to provide biologically active structures; in particular, facially amphiphilic peptides built from ОІ-amino acids have been shown to mimic both the structures as well as the biological function of natural antimicrobial peptides such as magainins and cecropins. However, these natural peptides as well as their ОІ-peptide analogues are expensive to prepare and difficult to produce on a large scale, limiting their potential use to certain pharmaceutical applications. We therefore have designed a series of facially amphiphilic arylamide polymers that capture the physical and biological properties of this class of antimicrobial peptides, but are easy to prepare from inexpensive monomers. The design process was aided by molecular calculations with density functional theory-computed torsional potentials. This new class of amphiphilic polymers may be applied in situations where inexpensive antimicrobial agents are required.},

	abstract = {We have developed and experimentally tested a novel computational approach for the de novo design of hydrophobic cores. A pair of computer programs has been written, the first of which creates a "custom" rotamer library for potential hydrophobic residues, based on the backbone structure of the protein of interest. The second program uses a genetic algorithm to globally optimize for a low energy core sequence and structure, using the custom rotamer library as input. Success of the programs in predicting the sequences of native proteins indicates that they should be effective tools for protein design. Using these programs, we have designed and engineered several variants of the phage 434 cro protein, containing five, seven, or eight sequence changes in the hydrophobic core. As controls, we have produced a variant consisting of a randomly generated core with six sequence changes but equal volume relative to the native core and a variant with a "minimalist" core containing predominantly leucine residues. Two of the designs, including one with eight core sequence changes, have thermal stabilities comparable to the native protein, whereas the third design and the minimalist protein are significantly destabilized. The randomly designed control is completely unfolded under equivalent conditions. These results suggest that rational de novo design of hydrophobic cores is feasible, and stress the importance of specific packing interactions for the stability of proteins. A surprising aspect of the results is that all of the variants display highly cooperative thermal denaturation curves and reasonably dispersed NMR spectra. This suggests that the non-core residues of a protein play a significant role in determining the uniqueness of the folded structure.},

Each gene encoded a different amino acid sequence, but all sequences shared the same pattern of polar and nonpolar residues. Characterization of the expressed proteins indicated that most of the designed sequences folded into compact О±-helical structures.

The As of these proteins can be determined to within 1 to 2 \% and that of their individual residues to within 10 to 20\%. The As values of proteins are correlated with their molecular weight (Mr) in the range 4000 to 35,000: the power law As = 6.3 M0.73 predicts protein As values to within 4\% on average. The average water-accessible surface is found to be 57\% non-polar, 24\% polar and 19\% charged, with 5\% root-mean-square variations. The molecular surface buried inside the protein is 58\% non-polar, 39\% polar and 4\% charged. The buried surface contains more uncharged polar groups (mostly peptides) than the surface that remains accessible, but many fewer charged groups. On average, 15\% of residues in small proteins and 32\% in larger ones may be classed as "buried residues", having less than 5\% of their surface accessible to the solvent. The accessibilities of most other residues are evenly distributed in the range 5 to 50\%. Although the fraction of buried residues increases with molecular weight, the amino acid compositions of the protein interior and surface show no systematic variation with molecular weight, except for small proteins that are often very rich in buried cysteines. From amino acid compositions of protein surfaces and interiors we calculate an effective coefficient of partition for each type of residue, and derive an implied set of transfer free energy values. This is compared with other sets of partition coefficients derived directly from experimental data. The extent to which groups of residues (charged, polar and non-polar) are buried within proteins correlates well with their hydrophobicity derived from amino acid transfer experiments. Within these three groups, the correlation is low.},

	abstract = {During biosynthesis, a globular protein folds into a tight particle with an interior core that is shielded from the surrounding solvent. The hydrophobic effect is thought to play a key role in mediating this process: nonpolar residues expelled from water engender a molecular interior where they can be buried. Paradoxically, results of earlier quantitative analyses have suggested that the tendency for nonpolar residues to be buried within proteins is weak. However, such analyses merely classify residues as either "exposed" or "buried." In the experiment reported in this article proteins of known structure were used to measure the average area that each residue buries upon folding. This characteristic quantity, the average area buried, is correlated with residue hydrophobicity. 10.1126/science.4023714},

The data obtained confirm that polar groups are generally found on the outside of proteins and nonpolar residues are generally found on the inside. Seven of the amino acids (Ala, Arg, Cys, His, Pro, Ser, Tyr) have inside/outside preferences which are not consistent with their usual assignment as either polar or nonpolar residues; explanations are given for these apparent inconsistencies. Of the three types of backbone structure considered here (extended, alpha helix, and nonregular), extended structures have the greatest preference for the inside of proteins, and nonregular structures have the greatest preference for the outside. It is suggested that differences in entropy play an important part in the inside/outside preferences of backbone structures. There are generally significant changes in the conformational preferences of the residues in going from the inside to the outside of proteins; environmental (rather than local) solute-solvent interactions seem to be the predominant cause of these changes in conformational preferences.},

@article{lawrence_1987,
	abstract = {Globular proteins fold into compact particles with interior amino acid residues shielded from the surrounding aqueous environment. An early hypothesis holds that entropic hydrophobic forces drive this phenomenon. However, previous analyses based on a binary description of the accessible surfaces of amino acid residues in proteins did not support this hypothesis. This report shows that a complete description of accessible surface areas is given by parametric distribution functions with three modes. The modes are formed by partitioning the available accessible surface area of the amino acids into three segments; the data for each segment are characterized by a mode-specific model. In the "repulsive" mode, probabilities of accessibility decrease exponentially with exposed surface area, as predicted by the hydrophobic hypothesis. A distinct "buried" mode is needed to account for an excess of residues at or near zero accessibility for most amino acids, consistent with the use of binary descriptions of accessibility. A third mode exists which is termed "near neutral" because it is described by a nearly uniform distribution of accessibility for the hydrophilic amino acids. Empirical energies calculated for the repulsive mode correlate well with measured free energies of transfer of amino acids from water to organic solvents, while those from the buried mode correlate well with measured free energies of hydration of the side chains. Poor cross correlations between these energies give an explanation for the previous conflict in interpreting these data.},

After correction to pH 7, the resulting scale of "hydration potentials", or free energies of transfer from the vapor phase to neutral aqueous solution, spans a range of approximately 22 kcal/mol. The side chain of arginine is much more hydrophilic than those of the other common amino acids, with an equilibrium constant of approximately 10(15) for transfer from the vapor phase to neutral aqueous solution. Hydration potentials are more closely correlated with the relative tendencies of the various amino acids to appear at the surface of globular proteins than had been evident from earlier distribution studies on the free amino acids.

Amino acid residues are characterized by two parameters: standard free energy of adsorption at the hexane/water interface and standard free energy of the partition between hexane and water. Theoretical approaches are used for the estimation of these parameters. As a result, several groups of amino acid units having close values of the parameters are distinguished. Classification of the amino acid units by such a method is believed to be able to provide promising results in the search of correlations in protein sequences. The comparison of experimental and theoretical studies of free amino acids at the hexane/water interface confirm the predictive power of the theory used, because a very good coincidence between theoretical and experimental data points is observed.

Ther. 18,369] form the basis for computational comparisons of protein stabilities by means of the atomic solvation parameter formalism of Eisenberg and McLachlan [(1986) Nature 319, 199]. In order to explore this approach for more complex systems, we have determined by octanol-to-water partitioning the solvation energies of (1) the guest (X) side chains in the host-guest pentapeptides AcWL-X-LL, (2) the carboxy terminus of the pentapeptides, and (3) the peptide bonds of the homologous series of peptides AcWLm (m = 1-6). Solvation parameters were derived from the solvation energies using estimates of the solvent-accessible surface areas (ASA) obtained from hard-sphere Monte Carlo simulations. The measurements lead to a side chain solvation-energy scale for the pentapeptides and suggest the need for modifying the Asp, Glu, and Cys values of the "Fauch\`{e}re-Pliska" solvation-energy scale fro the Ac-X-amides. We find that the unfavorable solvation energy of nonpolar residues can be calculated accurately by a solvation parameter of 22.8 +/- 0.8 cal/mol/A2, which agrees satisfactorily with the AC-X-amide data and thereby validates the Monte Carlo ASA results. Unlike the Ac-X-amide data, the apparent solvation energies of the uncharged polar residues are also largely unfavorable. This unexpected finding probably results, primarily, from differences in conformation and hydrogen bonding in octanol and buffer but may also be due to the additional flaking peptide bonds of the pentapeptides. The atomic solvation parameter (ASP) for the peptide bond is comparable to the ASP of the charged carboxy terminus which is an order of magnitude larger than the ASP of the uncharged polar side chains of the Ac-X-amides. The very large peptide bond ASP, -96 +/- 6 cal/mol/A2, profoundly affects the results of computational comparisons of protein stability which use ASPs derived from octanol-water partitioning data.},

@article{janin_1988,
	abstract = {The solvent-accessible surface area (As) of 23 oligomeric proteins is calculated using atomic co-ordinates from high-resolution and well-refined crystal structures. As is correlated with the protein molecular weight, and a power law predicts its value to within 5\% on average. The accessible surface of the average oligomer is similar to that of monomeric proteins in its hydropathy and amino acid composition. The distribution of the 20 amino acid types between the protein surface and its interior is also the same as in monomers. Interfaces, i.e. surfaces involved in subunit contacts, differ from the rest of the subunit surface. They are enriched in hydrophobic side-chains, yet they contain a number of charged groups, especially from Arg residues, which are the most abundant residues at interfaces except for Leu. Buried Arg residues are involved in H-bonds between subunits. We counted H-bonds at interfaces and found that several have none, others have one H-bond per 200 A2 of interface area on average (1 A = 0.1 nm). A majority of interface H-bonds involve charged donor or acceptor groups, which should make their contribution to the free energy of dissociation significant, even when they are few. The smaller interfaces cover about 700 A2 of the subunit surface. The larger ones cover 3000 to 10,000 A2, up to 40\% of the subunit surface area in catalase. The lower value corresponds to an estimate of the accessible surface area loss required for stabilizing subunit association through the hydrophobic effect alone. Oligomers with small interfaces have globular subunits with accessible surface areas similar to those of monomeric proteins. We suggest that these oligomers assemble from preformed monomers with little change in conformation. In oligomers with large interfaces, isolated subunits should be unstable given their excessively large accessible surface, and assembly is expected to require major structural changes.},

@article{amber2,
	abstract = {Molecular mechanics models have been applied extensively to study the dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids. Here we report the development of a third-generation point-charge all-atom force field for proteins. Following the earlier approach of Cornell et al., the charge set was obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potentials of dipeptides calculated using B3LYP/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical methods. The main-chain torsion parameters were obtained by fitting to the energy profiles of Ace-Ala-Nme and Ace-Gly-Nme di-peptides calculated using MP2/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical methods. All other parameters were taken from the existing AMBER data base. The major departure from previous force fields is that all quantum mechanical calculations were done in the condensed phase with continuum solvent models and an effective dielectric constant of epsilon = 4. We anticipate that this force field parameter set will address certain critical short comings of previous force fields in condensed-phase simulations of proteins. Initial tests on peptides demonstrated a high-degree of similarity between the calculated and the statistically measured Ramanchandran maps for both Ace-Gly-Nme and Ace-Ala-Nme di-peptides. Some highlights of our results include (1) well-preserved balance between the extended and helical region distributions, and (2) favorable type-II poly-proline helical region in agreement with recent experiments. Backward compatibility between the new and Cornell et al. charge sets, as judged by overall agreement between dipole moments, allows a smooth transition to the new force field in the area of ligand-binding calculations. Test simulations on a large set of proteins are also discussed.},

In this study, we have used molecular dynamics simulations to examine the insertion of three VOCs (ethanol, acetone and benzaldehyde) into the liquid-vapor interface of water (using the SPC/E water model). Our results are in agreement with the theoretical studies available in the literature. At 298 and 273 K, we have calculated theoretical mass accommodation coefficients from the Gibbs free energy profiles corresponding to the insertion of each VOC into the water interface. These calculations lead to a theoretical mass accommodation coefficient equal to 1.0 for each examined VOC at both temperatures.},

In an abridged historical background, the methodological milestones paving the road for today's free energy simulations are summarized. The continuing difficulties encountered when attempting to obtain accurate free energy estimates are then discussed, with an emphasis on the potential usefulness of such large-scale calculations in non-academic environments. Finally, current strategies for improving the reliability of free energy calculations, while at the same time making them more affordable (and thus more compatible with the constraints of the industrial environment) are discussed.},

	abstract = {We previously reported a class of tripeptide amphiphiles known as peptide lipids that self-assemble into one-dimensional nanostructures with superhelical twisting. The pitch of this supramolecular twisting is controlled directly through sterics in the molecular structure of hydrophobic segments. In this work we study the supramolecular behavior of these nanoscale helices by substituting with a terthiophene conjugated segment of potential electronic interest and also through variations in the stereochemistry of the tripeptide. This terthiophene peptide lipid was shown to self-assemble into one-dimensional helical nanofibers with a regular diameter of 9±1 nm and helical pitch of 65±6 nm, and also found to form hierarchical double- and triple-stranded helices, which could be associated with terthiophene J-aggregate interactions among fibers. For stereochemical effects, we compared four diastereomers in the tripeptide sequence using  l -glutamic acid and  l - and  d -alanine residues to probe their ability to control supramolecular organization. Interestingly, we found by atomic force microscopy that the LLD diastereomers formed cylindrical nanofibers without any twisting, whereas LDD diastereomeric segments self-assembled into helical nanofibers with a pitch of 40±6 nm. LDL diastereomeric segments formed, on the other hand, aggregates without any regular shape. We propose that these profound effects of chirality with amino acid sequence are related to changes in the ?-sheet sub-structure within the nanofibers.},

Using the 'oligomer as monomer' approach, polyterthiophene (co)polymer films have been generated, on Pt, Au and ITO-coated glass working electrodes, by repetitive scan cyclic voltammetry of solutions of 2,2[prime or minute]:5[prime or minute],2[double prime]-terthiophene, or either 3 or 4 along with 2,2[prime or minute]:5[prime or minute],2[double prime]-terthiophene itself. These films have been characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and in situ reflectance FTIR spectroscopy. FTIR spectroscopy suggests that the 2,2[prime or minute]:5[prime or minute],2[double prime]-terthiophene : 4 copolymer contains intact biotin moieties. The incubation of poly-2,2[prime or minute]:5[prime or minute],2[double prime]-terthiophene and 2,2[prime or minute]:5[prime or minute],2[double prime]-terthiophene : 4 copolymer with aqueous buffer solutions, followed by transfer back to CH3CN/0.1 M TEAT, results in only small changes in the film CV, whereas exposure of the biotin-functionalized 2,2[prime or minute]:5[prime or minute],2[double prime]-terthiophene : 4 copolymer to avidin causes drastic changes to its CV and its EIS, consistent with the binding of avidin by biotin resulting in restricted ion transfer to and from the polymer. The minimum amount of avidin which causes a detectable change in the electrochemistry of a 0.03 cm2 2,2[prime or minute]:5[prime or minute],2[double prime]-terthiophene : 4 copolymer-modified electrode is 5 [times] 10-14 moles. Exposure of the 2,2[prime or minute]:5[prime or minute],2[double prime]-terthiophene : 4 copolymer to excess bovine serum albumin in buffer causes only the same small changes in its electrochemistry as exposure to buffer alone, ruling out nonspecific adsorption as a cause of the electrochemical changes on avidin exposure.},

	abstract = {A novel family of glycopolythiophenes containing sialic acid or mannose ligands were prepared and evaluated for their ability to bind lectins, virus, and bacteria. For the set of glycopolythiophenes studied, the spacer-length between the polymer backbone and the ligand was varied to optimize binding interactions. The glycopolymers were blue-shifted (absorbance of ca. 400 nm) relative to the corresponding homo-polythiophenes (absorbance ca. 440 nm), suggesting a twisted conformation for the glycopolymers. The altered conformation is likely due to electrostatic or H-bonding interactions between the polymer chains, arising from the carbohydrate ligand. Further conformational changes in the polythiophene backbone were detected by the binding of specific receptors; lectins (wheat germ agglutinin, concanavalin A), Influenza virus, and Escherichia coli. The binding interactions result in an unusual red-shift in the visible absorption of the polymer backbone, suggesting a lengthening of the effective conjugated length upon interaction of the ligand with its congnate receptor. These conjugated glycopolymeric systems offer a potentially new platform for the detection of molecular binding interactions.},

The same mixed formulation is able to promote the outgrowth of neurites from primary mouse cortical neurons when the alkanethiol component is functionalized with a neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) binding antibody. Atomic force microscopy of the SAMs shows that they exert their effect through the well-known mechanism of increasing electrode surface area. These new covalently bound films have the potential to be more robust and are more controllable in their composition than existing electrodeposited conductive polymer coatings.},

Since the alpha-helical secondary structure of the PBLG block may be either maintained or suppressed depending on the solvent casting history, the PBLGPHFPBLG copolymers exhibit two different conformations: a rodrodrod or coilrodcoil configuration, respectively. In order to provide insight into the influence of conformation on self-aggregation of these systems, three copolymers with different block ratio were investigated in both conformations using small- and wide-angle scattering techniques and transmission electron microscopy. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were performed on the same samples to explore the effect of morphology on photophysical properties. The observed photoluminescence spectra and dominant excited lifetimes of the poly(9,9-dihexylfluorene-2,7-diyl) block were found to differ markedly in rodrodrod and coilrodcoil configurations and were correlated to the morphology of the self-assembled triblock copolymers.},

	abstract = {Self-assembly of beta-sheet domains resulting in the formation of pathogenic, fibrillar protein aggregates (amyloids) is a characteristic feature of various medical disorders. These include neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob's. A significant problem in studying such aggregation processes is the poor solubility of these beta-sheet complexes. The present work describes water-soluble de novo beta-sheet peptides which self-assemble into fibrillar structures. The model peptides enable studies of the relationship between beta-sheet stability and association behavior. The peptides [DPKGDPKG-(VT)n-GKGDPKPD-NH2, n = 3-8] are composed of a central beta-sheet-forming domain (VT-sequence), and N- and C-terminal nonstructured octapeptide sequences which promote water solubility. Conformational analyses by circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicate the influence of peptide length, D-amino acid substitution, and concentration on the ability of the peptides to form stable beta-sheet structures. The association behavior investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation and dynamic light scattering was found to correlate strongly with the stability of a beta-sheet conformation. Model peptides with n >/= 6 form stable, water-soluble beta-sheet complexes with molecular masses of more than 2000 kDa, which are organized in fibrillar structures. The fibrils examined by Congo Red staining and electron microscopy show some similarities with naturally occurring amyloid fibrils.},

Special emphasis is given to the systematic investigation of basis set effects by the use of correlation-consistent bases. We find that the MP2 and coupled-cluster potential energy curves agree well with each other, for a given basis set. However, unlike B3LYP, they are rather sensitive to the quality of the basis. The previously observed disagreement between the B3LYP and MP2 methods, especially on the degree of ring coplanarity in the minimum-energy  cis  and  trans  conformations, is considerably reduced upon adoption of a large and flexible basis set for the latter.},

@article{lammps_plimpton_1995,
	abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

Currently, flat panel displays, such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and plasma display panels (PDPs), satisfy them with regard to quality. Convenience and portability will be realized with flexible displays in the future. Polymers are very promising materials for flexible displays with many advantageous charateristics including transparency,  light  weight, flexibility, and robustness. They are also some of the least expensive materials and are suitable for mass production via roll-to-roll processes. In this review, we will discuss the kinds of polymers that are used, where and how polymer materials are used and the challenges to overcome in developing flexible displays.},

The first part is focused on intrinsic and induced receptor properties of conducting polymers, such as pH sensitivity, sensitivity to inorganic ions and organic molecules as well as sensitivity to gases. Induced receptor properties can be also formed by molecularly imprinted polymerization or by immobilization of biological receptors. Immobilization strategies are reviewed in the second part. The third part is focused on applications of conducting polymers as transducers and includes usual optical (fluorescence, SPR, etc.) and electrical (conductometric, amperometric, potentiometric, etc.) transducing techniques as well as organic chemosensitive semiconductor devices. An assembly of stable sensing structures requires strong binding of conducting polymers to solid supports. These aspects are discussed in the next part. Finally, an application of combinatorial synthesis and high-throughput analysis to the development and optimization of sensing materials is described.},

    abstract = {Combination of self-assembly at different length scales leads to structural hierarchies. It offers rich possibilities to construct nanostructured matter, nanoscale parts, and switching (responsive) properties based on the phase transitions of the self-assembled structures. Complexation of oligomeric amphiphiles to polymers using ionic interactions, coordination, or hydrogen bonding leads to polymeric comb-shaped supramolecules (complexes), which self-assemble at a length scale of a few nm. Self-assembly at an order of magnitude larger length scale is provided by block copolymers, and combination of the latter two concepts leads to structural hierarchies. They provide e.g. templates for mesoporous materials and nano-objects, and allow switching conductivity and switching optical properties. Structural hierarchies are also observed by complexing moderately monodisperse polymeric rods with amphiphiles. Finally, self-assembly at even a larger length scale upon using colloidal particles may be combined to the above structures, as encouraged by recent observations.},
